# My Resume

For my resume, I've created a new json file called "package.json" which is essentially, the heart of the project. It registers the metadata I have written for the resume I've created in my "info.json" file before being published to npm.

To access my info.json file, I've used the File System embedded in node to read and print my resume out.
